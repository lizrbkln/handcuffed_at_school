    <div class="container story">
      <p>Video <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@okayybriaa/video/7177057034322480430?_r=1&_t=8YCn8KaODIR&is_from_webapp=v1&item_id=7177057034322480430">footage</a> of a police officer handcuffing a 20 year old student in her college classroom went viral online earlier this week. Though New York city police and school safety officers’ protocol dictates that they cuff students in a semi-public space, not in a packed classroom, scenes like what happened in North Carolina occur regularly in New York City public schools, and to students much younger than 20.

        <p>

      <p>Students between the ages of 7 and 22 were placed in cuffs, most of them metal, more than 700 times between Jan. 1 and Sept. 30 of this year, according to NYPD <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/reports-analysis/school-safety">records</a>.
        <p>

      <p>“He's shaking. He's sobbing. He's normally under control, but he's a 13-year-old boy in handcuffs at school,” said Jill Bloomberg, a retired principal, remembering an 8th grader who was brought to her office by school security after an episode in the lunchroom where he’d shown signs of distress.

        <p>

      <p>The city’s Independent Budget Office <a href="https://ibo.nyc.ny.us/iboreports/a-full-accounting-how-much-does-new-york-city-spend-on-its-criminal-justice-system-2021.html">reported</a> last year that “Mayor de Blasio reached a compromise with the City Council to move school safety agents to DOE.” But that switch didn’t occur before Mayor Eric Adams, who ran on a pro-school safety platform, took office. He <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=mayor+adams+february+23+press+conference&oq=mayor+adams+february+23+press+conference&aqs=chrome..69i57j33i160l2j33i299.17473j1j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:e8bd5dc1,vid:GIodZnnsvAA">plans</a> to roll out, “a device that we're testing that allows us in a humane way to identify guns and weapons,” increasing scanning in schools. The news outlet The City <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2022/10/6/23391840/gun-detection-tech-evolv-eric-adams-subways"> reported</a> this week that these devices might be faulty.
        <p>

      <p>More scanners could mean students who might not have otherwise had an encounter with school safety or NYPD officers can end up in handcuffs and/or under arrest.
      <p>

     <p>The connection between encounters with school safety or NYPD in school and a more challenging future is well established. Jason Nance, dean and professor at Southern Methodist University, recently <a href="https://scholar.smu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2041&context=law_faculty"> published</a> a longitudinal review of the school-to-prison pipeline that states, “Students who are arrested are less likely to graduate from high school and more likely to be involved in the criminal justice system as adults.”
     </p>
     <p> In the first 3 quarters of 2022, 87% of students who experienced school safety or NYPD interventions in their school were Black or Latino, but these students make up only 64% of the overall DOE population. White students make up 15% of the school population, but only experienced 5% of school safety interventions, according to NYPD and DOE data. <p>

     <p>Use of restraints happened all over the city in this same period, but a few precincts stand out because more of their interventions included handcuffing students. The data provided by the city is difficult to parse, some of it includes names of schools that no longer exist. A better view would break out information by school level, allowing a close look at middle and high schools, where most interventions occur and it would include the number of students served by each precinct. What’s most clear in the data is that some students in NYC are having a lot of contact with police in their schools.<p>

       </div>
     <p>In February of 2021, some members of the City Council attempted to make changes to the way school safety operates.  The proposed <a href="https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=4772117&GUID=CB34AF5E-86BE-475F-BE25-562D12570412&Options=ID|Text|&Search=2211"> legislation</a> would have moved school safety from NYPD to the Department of Education. NYPD would only be called in “as necessary to address an imminent risk to public safety or property.” The proposed bill also said school safety agents would no longer carry handcuffs. The bill surely would have reduced the amount of students restrained in city schools, but it didn’t move through the legislative process before its sponsors left office. <p>


    <p>Bloomberg’s school, Park Slope Collegiate, which she led for 15 years, is one of many schools in the city where students are forced to pass through a metal detector on their way to class each day. Since 2016, “students of color made up 88 percent of total enrollment” in schools that scan, according to the <a href="https://www.nyclu.org/en/news/what-nypd-hiding-about-school-metal-detectors"> ACLU</a>.
</p>

    <p>The most recent <a href="https://cdn-blob-prd.azureedge.net/prd-pws/docs/default-source/default-document-library/scanning-protocols-in-nyc-doe-schools-english.pdf?sfvrsn=cfef48d6_6"> report</a> posted on the Department of Education website says there are 88 school buildings with permanent or part-time scanners and there are also roving scanners that show up at schools unannounced.  </p>

    <p>Students arrive early to wait in line. They place their items on a belt, much like one does at the airport, and they pass through an archway scanner. If an alarm is triggered an agent might use a wand to scan their body. </p>

    <p>Out of nearly 9000 NYPD interventions in the first 3 quarters of 2022, 2800 of them were connected to scanning students at school.
</p>
<p> While the NYPD <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/nypd/downloads/pdf/public_information/public-pguide3.pdf">  patrol</a> guide says that school safety and school leadership are supposed to decide together whether or not to move towards an arrest for “low level non-violent criminal incidents and violations of law,” with scanners on the first floor and Bloomberg’s office upstairs, incidents sometimes moved rapidly to restraints and arrest without her input. </p>

<p>A senior at Park Slope Collegiate had been using a lapel pin to keep his glasses hinged together for a few days, Bloomberg said. But one morning, a safety officer told the student to pass his glasses through the machine, “the school safety agent wouldn't give him back his glasses because she said the pin was a weapon. And I don't know exactly what happened, but I suspect he reached for his glasses anyway. And then, he ended up in cuffs.”
</p>
<p>Most interventions are recorded as “mitigated” in NYPD records.  Mitigated means “could have and should have been managed appropriately by school staff,” <a href="https://www.advocatesforchildren.org/node/2105"> according</a> to Advocates for Children, a group that supports students and families and regularly writes reports meant to influence policy and improve educational experiences for some of the system's most marginalized students.

</p>
<p>
“If you have two kids and your kids fight at home; they're not guilty of battery,” Bloomberg says, “the parent comes along and explains to you why that's not an acceptable way to deal with your frustration. You don't call the cops.”
</p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.cchsnyc.org/meetings/resolutions"> some</a> parents are calling for even more scanners in schools and a focus on school safety, others have long made the case that police do not have the skills needed to support students in distress or crisis.
</p>
<p>At a city council <a href="https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=4772117&GUID=CB34AF5E-86BE-475F-BE25-562D12570412&Options=ID%7CText%7C&Search=2211"> hearing</a> on school safety last year, Hope Newton, speaking as an advocate with Center for Family Representations Policy, said “School safety agents train for 17 weeks at the NYPD Police Academy. They learn about law, police behavior, police and behavioral science. School, teachers, principals, social workers, guidance counselors and administrators go to college for at least five years. They study everything from child psychology, child development, early education, leadership counseling to special education.”
</p>
<p>Newton was saying that safety agents, trained by NYPD, use the tools of law enforcement, restraints, for instance, not counseling techniques.
</p>
<p>While leading Park Slope Collegiate, Bloomberg noticed that some officers seemed to see putting a student in cuffs as no big deal.
</p>
<p>“You're rendered completely at the mercy of somebody else. It is the most dehumanizing experience,” she said, and school security, “will turn around, once they take the cuffs and say, ‘You’re free to go,’ as if nothing happened, ‘he was only in them for an hour.’”
</p>
<p>For Bloomberg, the current school security structure is not what schools need, "I wouldn't mind if there were people available at the school to help me if there's a crisis situation. But I don't want those people to be law enforcement," she said.
